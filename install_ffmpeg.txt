To install `ffmpeg` and make it available in your system's PATH on a macOS, you can use Homebrew, which is a package manager for macOS. Here are the steps:

1. First, you need to ensure that Homebrew is installed on your system. If not, you can install it using the following command in Terminal:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, update and upgrade Homebrew formulae with the following commands:

    ```bash
    brew update
    brew upgrade
    ```

3. Now you can install `ffmpeg` using Homebrew with the command:

    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```

After these steps, `ffmpeg` should be installed and available in your system's PATH[^1^]. You can verify the installation by typing `ffmpeg -version` in your Terminal. If it's installed correctly, it should display the version information of `ffmpeg`[^3^].
